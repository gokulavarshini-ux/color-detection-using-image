This project is a simple yet powerful application of computer vision that enables users to detect and identify colors within an image by clicking on any pixel. It leverages the OpenCV library for image processing and a color dataset to map RGB values to human-readable color names.

When a user clicks on a part of the image, the program:
- Captures the RGB values of the selected pixel.
- Compares them against a predefined dataset of colors.
- Displays the closest matching color name along with its RGB values directly on the image.

This tool is particularly useful for:
- Designers and developers working with precise color palettes.
- Educational demos in computer vision and image processing.
- Real-time applications in robotics, UI/UX, and digital accessibility.

By integrating basic machine perception with user interaction, this project showcases how AI can bridge sensory input and semantic understandingâ€”an idea that resonates with sociological models of perception and classification.
